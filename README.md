# Impact-of-Bridge-Design-Materials-and-Climate-Exposure-on-Deterioration-and-Condition
This project investigates how bridge design materials and climate conditions contribute to the deterioration of bridge structures. We use machine learning models to classify bridge conditions and draw insights from trends in structural design and geographic exposure.
